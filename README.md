# Serverless Website

&nbsp;

Deploy a static website to AWS S3 in seconds using [Serverless Components](https://github.com/serverless/components).

&nbsp;

1. [Install](#1-install)
2. [Create](#2-create)
3. [Configure](#3-configure)
4. [Deploy](#4-deploy)

&nbsp;

### 1. Install

```console
$ npm install -g serverless
```

### 2. Create

```console
$ mkdir my-website
$ cd my-website
```

the directory should look something like this:


```
|- code
  |- index.html
|- serverless.yml
|- .env      # your AWS api keys

```

```
# .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
```

The `code` directory could either be a simple directory of html/css/js assets files, or a full fledged React app.

### 3. Configure

```yml
# serverless.yml

name: my-website
stage: dev

myWebsite:
  component: "@serverless/website"
  inputs:
    code:
      root: ./ # The root folder of your website project.  Defaults to current working directory
      src: ./src # The folder to be uploaded containing your built artifact
      hook: npm run build # A hook to build/test/do anything to your code before uploading
      indexDocmeunt: if you need to override index document. Default is index.html
      errorDocmeunt: if you need to override error document. Default is index.html
    region: us-east-1 # The AWS region to deploy your website into
    bucketName: myBucket # (Optional) The Bucket name where `src` files/folder will be upload.

    domain: www.example.com
